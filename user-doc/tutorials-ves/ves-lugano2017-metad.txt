\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-1 The system

We consider the association/dissociation of NaCl in acqueous solution. 
The dissociation barrier is expected to be around 2.5 \f$k_B T\f$.
One interesting aspect of the ion dissociation problem is that collective
solvent motions play an important role in the transition.
This problem has been considered in the original metadynamics paper \cite
metad and also in reference \cite tps2 .
We will use the potential developed in ref.\ \cite Pettitt-JCP-1986 for NaCl and TIP3P water with
parameters corrected to be used with long-range Coulomb solvers \cite Price-JCP-2004. 
The system contains 1 Na, 1 Cl, and 106 water molecules (total 320 atoms).

\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-2 Perform an unbiased simulation and control the distance Na-Cl

We first perform a standard MD simulation and control the distance Na-Cl. 
All the files needed for this example are contain in Example1.tar .
The distance Na-Cl can be calculated in Plumed 2 using:
\verbatim
d1:  DISTANCE ATOMS=319,320
\endverbatim
t

We will limit the exploration of the CV space by introducing an upper wall bias \f$ V_{wall}(\mathbf{s}) \f$.
The wall will focus the sampling in the most interesting region of the free
energy surface. The effect of this bias potential will have to be corrected later in order to calculate
 ensemble averages. The syntax in Plumed 2 is:
\verbatim
UPPER_WALLS ...
 ARG=d1
 AT=0.6
 KAPPA=2000.0
 EXP=2
 EPS=1
 OFFSET=0.
 LABEL=uwall
... UPPER_WALLS
\endverbatim

The coordination number of Na and O in water will also be calculated for later
use. This variable will represent the collective motion of the solvent.
\verbatim
COORDINATION ...
 GROUPA=319
 GROUPB=1-318:3
 SWITCH={RATIONAL R_0=0.315 D_MAX=0.5 NN=12 MM=24}
 NLIST
 NL_CUTOFF=0.55
 NL_STRIDE=10
 LABEL=coord
... COORDINATION
\endverbatim

To run LAMMPS you can use the run.sh script:
\verbatim

#!/bin/bash

############################################################################
# Definition of variables
############################################################################
EXE=lmp_mpi
coresPerPart=4
Partitions=1
totalCores=4
############################################################################

mpirun -np ${totalCores} ${EXE} -p ${Partitions}x${coresPerPart} -in start.lmp

\endverbatim

This command runs LAMMPS with the option of using many partitions. 
This will be useful when using multiple walkers.
In the example above 1 partition with 4 MPI threads is used.  

Once the simulation is launched, the so called COLVAR file is written. In this case it contains the following:
\verbatim
#! FIELDS time d1 coord uwall.bias uwall.force2
 0.200000 0.568067 5.506808 0.000000 0.000000

 2.000000 0.489058 4.897593 0.000000 0.000000
.

.
\endverbatim
If you plot the time (column 1) vs the distance (column 2) 
you will see that the ion pair is stuck in the dissociated state during the 1 ns simulation.
It is unable to cross the \f$ \sim 5 k_BT\f$ barrier located at a distance of approximately
 0.4 nm and it cannot go beyond a distance of 0.65 nm since we introduced a wall. If we want the system to visit the associated state, we will need enhanced sampling.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-3 Construct a bias potential on the distance Na-Cl

We now construct a bias potential \f$ V(\mathbf{s}) \f$ on the distance Na-Cl using well-tempered metadynamics.
The files for this example are contained in Example2.tar.
As argument for the construction of the potential we will use the distance Na-Cl (label d1).
We choose a gaussian height of 1 kJ/mol which is slightly less than 0.5 \f$k_B
T \f$. The gaussian width is 0.02 nm, in the same order of the features in the
FES. The bias factor is set to 5 since the largest barrier in the FES is
expected to be roughly 5 \f$k_BT\f$. Once the metadynamics simulation is
converged, the system will evolve under an effective free energy:
\f[
	\tilde{F}(\mathbf{s})=F(\mathbf{s})+V(\mathbf{s})=
\frac{F(\mathbf{s})}{\gamma},
\f]
that is to say, the largest barrier will be of around 1 \f$k_BT\f$. The input is:
\verbatim
METAD ...
 LABEL=metad
 ARG=d1
 SIGMA=0.02
 HEIGHT=1.
 BIASFACTOR=5
 TEMP=300.0
 PACE=500
 GRID_MIN=0.2
 GRID_MAX=1.0
 GRID_BIN=300
 REWEIGHTING_NGRID=300
... METAD
\endverbatim

It is possible to try different bias factors to check the effect that it has in
the trajectory and the effective FES.

In principle the cost of a metadynamics simulation should increase as the
simulation progresses due to the need of adding an increasing number of
gaussians to calculate the bias. However, since a grid is used to build up the
bias this effect is not observed. You can check what happens if you do not use the
GRID_* keywords. Remember that the bins in the grid should be small enough to
describe the changes in the bias created by the gaussians. Normally a bin of
\f$ \sigma / 5 \f$ (with \f$ \sigma \f$ the gaussian width) is small enough.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-4 Assess convergence

One way to identify if a WT-MetaD simulation has converged is observing the
estimated free energy surface at different times. The FES is estimated by
using the relation (up to an arbitrary constant):
\f[
	F(\mathbf{s}) = \left ( \frac{\gamma}{\gamma-1} \right ) V(\mathbf{s},t)
\f]
and the bias potential is calculated as a sum of gaussians.
This can be done with Plumed 2 using for instance:
\verbatim
plumed sum_hills --hills ../HILLS.0 --min 0.1 --max 0.8 --bin 300 --stride 100
\endverbatim
Most of the flags are self explanatory. The flag --stride 100 will result in
the FES been written every 100 gaussians, i.e. 100 ps. 
Inside the folder FES_calculation you will find a script run.sh that executes the sum_hills command and a gnuplot script plot.gpi that can be used typing:.
\verbatim
gnuplot plot.gpi
\endverbatim
After roughly 3 ns the free
 energy surface does not change significantly with time except for an immaterial
 constant $c(t)$ that grows in time. This is in line with well-tempered metadynamics 
asymptotic behaviour:
\f[
	V(\mathbf{s},t)= \left ( 1- \frac{1}{\gamma} \right ) F(\mathbf{s}) +
c(t).
\f]
\anchor ves-school-2017-metad-fesEvolution
\image html Metad-fesEvolution.png "Evolution of the estimated free energy"

One must recall that we are actually not calculating the free energy \f$ F(\mathbf{s}) \f$ but rather \f$ F(\mathbf{s})+V_{wall}(\mathbf{s}) \f$.
For this reason for distances higher than 0.6 nm the free energy increases sharply.


An alternative way to observe the evolution of the bias is plotting the final
free energy plus the instantaneous bias. 
The scripts for this example can be found in the folder Bias_calculation.
In this case we observe only the first 200 ps of the simulation. 
The (negative) bias can be calculated using:
\verbatim
plumed sum_hills --hills ../HILLS.0 --min 0.1 --max 0.8 --bin 300 --stride 100 --negbias
\endverbatim
This plot illustrates clearly how the bias is constructed to progressively "fill" the FES.
\anchor ves-school-2017-metad-biasEvolution
\image html Metad-biasEvolution.png "Evolution of the bias potential"



It is also possible to track convergence by controlling the evolution of some
quantity connected to the free energy surface. 
The scripts for this example are found in the folder Barrier_calculation.
In this case we will calculate the dissociation barrier. 
Using the python script barrier_calculation.py  we can compute the barrier, for instance:
\verbatim
import numpy as np

# Total number of fes files in folder
total_files=101
# Min and max initial guesses
min_min=50
min_max=90
max_min=90
max_max=130

for i in range(total_files):
        file_name="fes_" + str(i) + ".dat"
        matrix=np.genfromtxt(file_name)
        minimum=np.amin(matrix[min_min:min_max,1])
        maximum=np.amax(matrix[max_min:max_max,1])
        print(str(i) + " " + str(minimum) + " " + str(maximum) + " " + str(maximum-minimum))
\endverbatim

The script can be executed using:
\verbatim
barrier_calculation.py
\endverbatim
After roughly 4 ns the barrier stabilizes around 3 and 3.5 \f$k_BT\f$.
\anchor ves-school-2017-metad-barrier
\image html Metad-barrier.png "Dissociation barrier as a function of simulation time"

Reweighting the simulation on the same CV that was used for biasing can also
be used as a test of convergence. We will show that in the next section.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-5 Reweight the simulation

We first reweight the simulation on the distance Na-Cl, the same CV used for
biasing. 
The scripts to perform this calculation are found in the folder ReweightDistance.
In the quasistationary limit the weight assigned to a given configuration is:
\f[
  w(\mathbf{R}) \propto  e^{\beta ( V(\mathbf{s},t) - c(t) )}
\f]
By plotting c(t) (column 6) versus time (column 1), the importance of taking c(t) into account
becomes clear.
 c(t) keeps growing even after long times, reflecting the
approximately rigid shift of the bias with time. 
Normally the first part of the trajectory is not used for reweighting since
during this period the simulation has not reached the quasistationary limit.
In this case we can discard the first 2 or 3 ns of simulation.
To disregard the first 3 ns of simulation we can use sed to delete the first 15000 lines from the COLVAR file:
\verbatim
sed '2,15000d' ../COLVAR.0 > COLVAR.0
\endverbatim

We then use Plumed to calculate two histograms, one taking into account the wall bias and the other one neglecting it.
The weights for the reweighting involving only the metadynamics bias will be:
\f[
  w(\mathbf{R}) \propto  e^{\beta ( V(\mathbf{s},t) - c(t) )},
\f]
while the weights considering both biases are:
\f[
  w(\mathbf{R}) \propto  e^{\beta ( V(\mathbf{s},t) - c(t) + V_{wall}(\mathbf{s}) )},
\f]
The input script for Plumed is:
\verbatim
# Read COLVAR file
distance:       READ FILE=COLVAR.0  IGNORE_TIME VALUES=d1
metad:       READ FILE=COLVAR.0 IGNORE_TIME VALUES=metad.rbias
uwall:       READ FILE=COLVAR.0 IGNORE_TIME VALUES=uwall.bias

# Define weights
weights1: REWEIGHT_METAD TEMP=300
weights2: REWEIGHT_BIAS TEMP=300 ARG=metad.rbias,uwall.bias

# Calculate histograms
HISTOGRAM ...
  ARG=distance
  GRID_MIN=0.2
  GRID_MAX=0.8
  GRID_BIN=100
  BANDWIDTH=0.002
  LOGWEIGHTS=weights1
  LABEL=hh1
... HISTOGRAM

HISTOGRAM ...
  ARG=distance
  GRID_MIN=0.2
  GRID_MAX=0.8
  GRID_BIN=100
  BANDWIDTH=0.002
  LOGWEIGHTS=weights2
  LABEL=hh2
... HISTOGRAM

# Print histograms to file
DUMPGRID GRID=hh1 FILE=histo FMT=%24.16e
DUMPGRID GRID=hh2 FILE=histo_wall FMT=%24.16e
\endverbatim

This example will generate the files histo and histo_wall. 
The histograms represent the probability \f$p(\mathbf{s})\f$ of observing a given value of the CV \f$ \matbf{s} \f$ .
From the histograms the FES can be calulated using:
\f[
\beta F(\mathbf{s})= - \log p(\mathbf{s})
\f]
and therefore we plot the FES in gnuplot using for instance:
\verbatim
pl  "./histo" u 1:(-log($2)) w lp
\endverbatim

We now compare the estimations of the free energy surface obtained from
sum_hills and from reweighting. You will find a gnuplot script plot.gpi inside the ReweightDistance folder.
This reweighting is useful to check convergence and to
have an estimate of the free energy that does not rely on using kernels. For
instance if some features of the FES could not be captured by the kernels, the
reweighting procedure will show them. This will become clearer in the VES
tutorial.

\image html Metad-reweightDist.png "FES estimated from sum_hills, reweighting using only the metadynamics bias, and reweighting using both the metadynamics bias and the upper wall bias"

We can obtain important information of the system by reweighting on 2 CVs: The
distance Na-Cl and the coordination of Na with O. 
This reweighting is similar to the one already done and the files that you will need are located in the ReweightBoth folder.
The plot of the FES as a function of these 2 CVs provides important 
information of the association/dissociation mechanism. In the
dissociated state, Na can have a coordination of 5 or 6, though it is more
likely to find a coordination number of 6. However, in order to associate Na
must have a coordination with O of 5. In the associated state Na can have a
coordination of 3, 4 or 5. The transition state is characterized by a
coordination number of ~5.

\subsection ves-lugano2017-metad-subsection-6 Construct a bias potential on the coordination Na-O

We construct a bias potential on the coordination Na-0.

The exploration of the CV space is not good since there is a slow degree of
freedom that we are not biasing: the distance Na-Cl.
