\section trieste-3-aims Aims

The aim of this tutorial is to introduce the users to the use of constant biases in PLUMED. 

\section trieste-3-objectives Objectives

- Apply a restraint on a simulations over one or more collective variables 
- Understand the effect of a restraint on the acquired statistics
- Perform a simple unbiasing of a restrained simulation
- Add an external potential in the form of an analytical or numerical function

\section trieste-3-resources Resources

The \tarball{trieste-3} for this tutorial contains the following files:
- wdimer.pdb: a PDB file for two molecules of water in vacuo
- wdimer.tpr: a GROMACS run file to perform MD of two water molecules
- diala.pdb: a PDB file for alanine dipeptide in vacuo
- diala.tpr: a GROMACS run file to perform MD of alanine dipeptide
- do_block_fes.py: a python script to perform error analysis

This tutorial has been tested on a pre-release version of version 2.4. However, it should not take advantage
of 2.4-only features, thus should also work with version 2.3.

\section trieste-3-intro Introduction

PLUMED can calculate conformational properties of a system a posteriori as well as on-the-fly. This information can be use to manipulate a simulation on-the-fly. This means adding energy terms in addition to those of the original Hamiltonian. This additional energy terms are usually refered as \ref Bias.
In the following we will see how to apply a constant bias potential with PLUMED.

\hidden{Summary of theory}
\endhidden

We will make use of two toy models: the first is a water dimer, i.e. two molecules of water in vacuo, that we will use to compare the effect of a constant bias on the equilibrium properties of the system that in this case can be readily computed. The second toy model is alanine dipeptide in vacuo. This system is more challanging to characterise with a standard MD simulation and we will see how we can use an interative approach to to build a constant bias that will help in flattening the underlying free energy surface and thus sped up the sampling.

\section trieste-3-ex-1 Exercize 1: converged histogram of the water dimer relative distance

First of all let's start to learn something about the water dimer system by running a first simulations. You can start by creating a folder with the dimer.tpr file and run a simulation.

\verbatim
> gmx mdrun -s dimer.tpr  
\endverbatim

In this way we have a 25ns long trajectory that we can use to have a first look at the behavior of the system.
Is the sampling of the relative distance between the two water molecules converged?

\subsection trieste-3-ex-1a Exercize 1a:  

Use plumed driver to analyse the trajectory and evaluate the quality of the sampling.

Here you can find a sample `plumed.dat` file that you can use as a template.
Whenever you see an highlighted \highlight{FILL} string, this is a string that you should replace.

\plumedfile
#compute the distance between the two oxygens
d: DISTANCE __FILL__
#accumulate block histograms
hh: HISTOGRAM ARG=d KERNEL=DISCRETE __FILL__
#and dump them
DUMPGRID __FILL__
# Print the collective variable.
PRINT __FILL__ 
\endplumedfile

\verbatim
> plumed driver --mf_xtc traj_comp.xtc --plumed plumed.dat  
\endverbatim

If there is something you don't remember about this procedure go back and check in \ref trieste-2 .
There you can also find a python script to perform block averaging of the histograms and assess the error. 
The result should be comparable with the following:
\image html trieste-3-histo-dimer.png "A histogram of the relative distance (in nm) with errors"
Notice the peak at 0.9 nm, this is the effect of using cut-off for the calculation of the interactions in the simulation (check the run-dimer.mdp file for the properties of the run)

\section trieste-3-ex-2 Exercize 2: Apply a linear restraint on the same collective variable 
Now we will try to apply a linear restraint on the relative distance and compare the resulting distribution.
The new sampling will reflect the effect of the bias.

\plumedfile
#compute the distance between the two oxygens
d: DISTANCE __FILL__
#accumulate block histograms
hh: HISTOGRAM ARG=d KERNEL=DISCRETE __FILL__
#and dump them
DUMPGRID __FILL__

#apply a linear restraint
lr: RESTRAINT ARG=d KAPPA=0 AT=0 SLOPE=2.5


# Print the collective variable and the bias.
PRINT __FILL__ 
\endplumedfile

In a new folder we can run this new simulation this time biasing and analysing the simulation on-the-fly.

\verbatim
> gmx mdrun -s dimer.tpr -plumed plumed.dat 
\endverbatim

The histogram should look different.

The effect of a constant bias is that of systematically changing the probability of each conformation by a factor
\f$ \exp(+V_{bias}/k_{B}T} \f$. This means that it is easely possible to recover the unbias distribution at least in the regions of the conformational space that have been througly sampled. In practice the statistical weight of each frame is not 1 anymore but is given by the exponential of the bias.

In order to recover the unbiased distribution we can post process the simulation using plumed driver to recalculate the bias felt by each frame and store this information to analyse any property. Furthermore plumed can also automatically use the bias to reweight the accumulated histogram.

\plumedfile
d: DISTANCE __FILL__ 

lr: RESTRAINT __FILL__ 
as: REWEIGHT_BIAS TEMP=298

HISTOGRAM ...
  __FILL__
  LOGWEIGHTS=as
... HISTOGRAM

DUMPGRID __FILL__
PRINT ARG=*.* FILE=COLVAR STRIDE=1
\endplumedfile

\verbatim
> plumed driver --mf_xtc traj_comp.xtc --plumed plumed.dat  
\endverbatim

Now the resulting histogram should be comparable to the reference one.

\section trieste-3-ex-3 Exercize 3: Apply a quadratic restraint on the same collective variable 

Do you expect a different behaviour? This time we can write the plumed input file in such a way to compare directly the biased and unbiased histograms.

\plumedfile
#calculate the distance
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,4
#apply the quadratic restraint centered at a distance of 0.5 nm
lr: RESTRAINT ARG=d KAPPA=10 AT=0.5 
#accumulate the biased histogram
hh: HISTOGRAM ARG=d STRIDE=1 GRID_MIN=0 GRID_MAX=4.0 GRID_BIN=200 KERNEL=DISCRETE CLEAR=100000
#dumpit
DUMPGRID GRID=hh FILE=myhist.dat STRIDE=100000
#calculate the weights from the constant bias
as: REWEIGHT_BIAS TEMP=298
#accumulate the unbiased histogram
hhu: HISTOGRAM ARG=d STRIDE=1 GRID_MIN=0 GRID_MAX=4.0 GRID_BIN=200 KERNEL=DISCRETE CLEAR=100000 LOGWEIGHTS=as
#dumpit
DUMPGRID GRID=hhu FILE=myhistu.dat STRIDE=100000
#print distance and bias
PRINT ARG=d FILE=distance,lr.bias STRIDE=50
\endplumedfile

The comparison of the two histograms with the former will show the effect of the weak quadratic bias on the simulation.

\section trieste-3-ex-4 Exercize 4: Apply an upper wall on the distance.
In the above cases we have always applied weak biases. Sometimes biases are usefull to prevent the system in reaching some region of the conformational space. In this case instead of using \ref RESTRAINT , we can make use of lower or upper restraints, e.g. \ref LOWER_WALLS and \ref UPPER_WALLS.

What happen to the histogram when we use walls? 

\plumedfile
d: DISTANCE ATOMS=1,4
uw: UPPER_WALLS ARG=d KAPPA=1000 AT=2.5
# accumulate the biased histogram
__FILL__
#dumpit
__FILL__
# calcualte the weights from the constant bias
__FILL__
#accumulate the unbiased histogram
__FILL__
#dumpit
__FILL__
#print distance and bias
__FILL__
\endplumedfile

If we have not sampled a region througly enough it is not possible to estimate the histogram in that region even using reweighting (reweighting is not magic!).

\section trieste-3-ex-5 Exercize 5: Evaluate the free energy and use it as an external restraint

- Exercise 7
Run Alanine dipeptide 

- Exercise 8
Run Alanine dipeptide adding a gaussian potential centered at psi=-1

- Exercise 9
