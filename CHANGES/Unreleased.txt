@page CHANGES-UNRELEASED Unreleased changes

This page contains changes that will end up in 2.3

Changes from version 2.2 which are relevant for users:
- Changes leading to incompatible behavior:
  - \ref COMMITTOR can now be used to define multiple basins, but the syntax has been changed
- New actions:
  - \ref FIXEDATOM
- New features for existing actions:
  - The SPECIES and SPECIESA keyword in MultiColvars can now take a multicolvar as input.  This allows one
    to calculate quantities such as the Q4 parameters for those atoms that have a coordination number greater
    than x.
  - In rational switching functions, by default MM is twice NN. This is valid both in \ref switchingfunction with expanded
    syntax and when specifying MM on e.g. \ref COORDINATION
  - Added MATHEVAL type in \ref switchingfunction
